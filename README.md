### REST ("Architectural concept")
#### The REST architecture, which stands for "Representational State Transfer," is an architectural style used in the development of distributed systems, such as web applications and web services. It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral thesis in 2000 and has become a popular approach for designing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and online services.

The main concept behind the REST architecture is the idea that interactions between system components should be based on a representation of resources and their state, rather than maintaining persistent session state between requests. This promotes scalability, modularity, and simplicity in component interactions.

Key principles of the REST architecture:

Resources: In REST, everything is considered a resource. A resource is a digital entity that can be represented, accessed, or manipulated through a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

Uniform Interfaces: REST advocates a uniform approach to interactions, using four basic operations:

GET: Retrieve information about a resource.

POST: Create a new resource.

PUT: Update an existing resource.

DELETE: Remove a resource.

Representational State: Requests made to a REST server must contain all the information needed to understand the operation. This avoids the need to maintain state information on the server.

Stateless Connections: Each client request to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. The server should not maintain state information about the client between requests.

Layered System: The system can consist of multiple layers, where each layer knows nothing about the layers beyond it. This allows for a clear separation of concerns and facilitates maintenance and scalability.

Cache: The use of caching is encouraged to improve efficiency and reduce latency. Server responses can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable.

Code-on-Demand (Optional): This is an optional feature in REST, allowing the server to send executable code to the client, thereby extending client functionality. However, this part is often omitted in REST implementations.

In summary, the REST architecture promotes the construction of web systems and services based on widely accepted standards and fundamental principles, leading to greater scalability, performance, and simplicity in interactions among distributed components.
